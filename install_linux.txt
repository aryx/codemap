To install pfff under Linux, you will first need to install several development
packages usually not present in a default install:
 - gtk2-devel
 - atk-devel
 - pango-devel
 - cairo-devel

for RedHat: sudo yum install gtk2-devel ...
for Gentoo: sudo emerge gtk2 ...
for Arch: sudo pacman gtk2 ...
For Debian or Ubuntu: apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev, libcairo2-dev, libpango1.0-dev
 (library packages are named differently under Debian; they have a 'lib' prefix)
 You'll also need to install perl-pod-usage to be able to run configure itself.
