# codemap
Source code visualizer

## Usage for `codemap`
```sh
$ ./codemap ~/pfff
```
This should launch a gtk-based GUI that allows you to visualize
source code and perform some code search.

See the old page of codemap at Facebook here:
https://github.com/facebookarchive/pfff/wiki/CodeMap
for more information.
