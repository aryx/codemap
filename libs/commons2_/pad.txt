This used to be in Semgrep but got removed at some point and so
it's reintroduced temporarily in Codemap which is still relying
unfortunately on many functions from the Common2 module.
The module was renamed and added an '_' suffix to make it differ
from the Common2.ml that still exists in Semgrep.
