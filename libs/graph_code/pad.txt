This used to be in semgrep, then semgrep-pro, and now is back in codemap.
Note that graph_code/ defines the main data structures for the codegraph
tool, but it's now used also in codemap and to avoid mutual dependencies
between codemap and codegraph, graph_code/ is in codemap/libs instead
of codegraph/libs.
