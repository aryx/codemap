(*s: readable_to_absolute_filename_under_root *)
(* People may run the visualizer on a subdir of what is mentionned in the
 * database code (e.g. subdir ~/www/flib of ~/www). The light_db
 * contains only readable paths (e.g. flib/foo.php); the reason for
 * those readable paths is that we want to reuse the light_db
 * and share it among multiple users which may have
 * different paths for their own software repo (e.g. ~/www4/).
 * 
 * When the user select an entity through the search box,
 * we will know the readable paths of the entity he is looking for
 * but we need a full path for refreshing the treemap.
 * We can not just concatenate the root with the readable paths which
 * in the example would lead to the path  ~/www/flib/flib/foo.php.
 * 
 * The goal of the function below is given a readable path like
 * flib/foo.php and a root like ~/www/flib  to recognize the common part
 * and return a valid fullpath like ~/www/flib/foo.php
 *
