(* Layers macrolevel *)
(*****************************************************************************)

(* How should we draw layer information at the macro level ?
 *   
 *  - fill the rectangle with the color of one layer ? 
 *  - separate equally among layers ? 
 *  - draw on top of the existing archi color ?
 *  - draw circles instead of rectangle so have quantitative information too 
 *    (like I was doing when display git related commit information).
 * 
 * It is maybe good to not draw on top of the existing archi_code color. 
 * Too many colors kill colors. Also we can not convey quantitative 
 * information by coloring with full rectangles (instead of the random
 * circles trick) but for some layers like security it is probably better.
 * Don't care so much about how many bad calls; care really about
 * number of files with bad calls in them.
 * 
 * So for now we just fill rectangles with colors from the layer and
 * when a file matches multiple layers we split the rectangle in equal
 * parts.
