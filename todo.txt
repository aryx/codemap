*** use model-view-update to simplify the code?

*** fix efuns, codemap, emacs config, macos config, etc.

**** efuns: Thread.kill not available and all those
second cursor errors

**** codemap: no more regexps displayed, just the leading /
because split_info? need put back in stream of tokens?

*** RELAX move arch_code.* out of pfff, move h_visualization/ too
put in codemap

*** RELAX maybe move highlight_code.ml in codemap 
so easy to change color constructor?

*** RELAX add highlight_code.ml to Visual.mw?

*** codemap not highlighing correctly fields in visitors
in Analyze_pattern.ml

*** move all pfff/todo.txt in codemap/todo.txt


*** make it work on MacOS!
seems to display at the beginning, especially id don't add -screen_size
and use default, but after it disappears

*** rely on Naming_AST.ml to uncomment code in Highlight_AST.ml
for better color for params, locals, globals (test on C code),
but also improve method vs func, etc. 
Fix all the commented-out code.

*** switch to lablgtk3?
even gtk4 lately.

*** factorize AST-based lang-specific highlighters in Highlight_AST.ml?
Java,
Python,
etc.
so can remove more visitor_xxx.ml ?

*** switch to revery? more portable? better code orga? FRP/ELM wins?

*** codemap on parser_ruby.dyp does not work anymore
