To install pfff under macOS, you must first install Brew (see http://brew.sh)
or MacPorts (see http://www.macports.org/).

Then, install a few packages, for example with Brew:
 $ brew install objective-caml

For codemap and codegraph, you need also to install an X11 server.
Install xquartz at http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/ and then install
a few more packages:
 $ brew install gtk+
 $ brew install cairo

Troubles?
---------

- If you are using homebrew you may have problems compiling ocamlgtk and 
  ocamlcairo. First You need to 
     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/opt/libpng/lib/pkgconfig
  so that configure can find one cairo.pc (the cairo of brew is keg-only),
  and libpng16.pc. To test you can do
     'pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags'
  and play with PKG_CONFIG_PATH until this previous command works.
  Once this works, you want to force to link with the new cairo library in
  homebrew because the default one of MacOS is causing a segfault.
  So add -L/usr/local/opt/cairo/lib in the generated config.make
  of ocamlcairo for the CAIRO_LIBS variable
  (yep it's unfortunate and ugly).
  update: I was enable to make codemap/codegraph work on Macos Lion (10.7).
  Even after playing with PKG_CONFIG_PATH I got some runtime errors
  about Fatal error 35 with xquartz. I think recent version of Xquartz and
  brew don't mix well with old versions of MacOS.

- If you have problem installing cairo and get an error message like:
  "Error: db46 requires the Java for Mac OS X development headers.
  Error: Download the Java Developer Package from: 
  <https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/getSoftware?bundleID=20719>"
  "
  then follows the link and install the Java Developer Package.

  An alternative fix may be to reinstall XCode as indicated at:

- If you have problem installing gtk2 and get an error related to atk,
  do: 
    $ sudo port install gobject-introspection 
  and
    $ sudo port install gtk2
  again.

- If you have a problem when compiling pfff in its external/ocamlgtk directory
  with an error like:
  "Error: Error on dynamically loaded library: 
   ./dlllablgtk2.so: dlopen(./dlllablgtk2.so, 138): 
   Symbol not found: _g_simple_async_result_take_error"
 do:
   $ sudo port selfupdate
   $ sudo port upgrade outdated
 which should update glib2 and fix the bug.

- For cairo and gtk don't use the quartz setting as it is currently
  buggy under macports.
