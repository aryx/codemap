(* This can be quite cpu intensive. CairoH.text_extents is quite slow
 * so you must avoid calling it too much. A simple optimisation
 * when the treemap is big is to avoid trying to draw labels
 * that are too tiny already.
 * 
 * note that this function is also called when we mouse over a rectangle
 * in which case we redraw the label in a different color
 * 
 * design: good to have a color different for dir and files.
 * 
 * design: could decide to give different colors to dirs depending on its
 * depth, like red for toplevel dir, green, and so on, like I do for 
 * my code sections, but feel simpler to just have one.
 * The rectangles will already have different colors and in the end
 * the depth does not have that much meaning in projects. For instance
 * in java code there are lots of nested directories (org/apache/...),
 * in some projects there is always an intermediate src/ directory;
 * each software have different conventions.
