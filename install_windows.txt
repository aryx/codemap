To install Pfff under Windows, you must first install Cygwin (see https://www.cygwin.com/).

Then, install a few Cygwin packages:
 - autoconf (needed to install from source many opam packages)
 - automake
 - xinit (which will pull lots of other dependencies)
 - lablgtk2-devel (which will pull lots of other dependencies)
 - cairo-devel
 - opam

Once OPAM is installed, you will need to install a compatible
version of OCaml and a few OPAM packages:
 - opam init
 - opam switch 4.02.3
 - opam install lablgtk2 cairo ocamlgraph

Then to run codemap or codegraph you will need to start the Cygwin/X server.
For example run startxwin in one window and in another window do:

  $ export DISPLAY=:0
  $ ./codemap.exe .

Troubles?
------------
- If 'opam init' seems to never finish, still wait and later on, even
  if the command does not terminate, you should get a valid ~/.opam/
  directory.
- If you have problem installing cairo under OPAM, you will need
  to use instead the 'battery-included' version of this package,
  or to manually go to ~/.opam/4.02.3/build/cairo.1.2.0/ and run the
  make; make opt; make install yourself.
